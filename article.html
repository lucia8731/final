            <p class="ex">This is a simulator that calculates income tax and resident tax for a given year based on input such as annual income and number of dependents using Japan's system. <br>Calculating tax amounts is by no means straightforward. <br>To obtain accurate figures, precise calculations are necessary. <br>Let me explain the calculation method below.</p>

              <p>2. Calculate Employment Income Deductions<br>This involves calculating the income deductions. First, calculate the employment income deduction, which is allocated equally to everyone. Since the calculation method varies depending on the income, please refer to the table below.</p>
