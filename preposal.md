# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I will build a web application aimed at providing users with an easy way to navigate Tokyo's complex subway system. It will consist of multiple pages, including a homepage with an overview of the subway system, a route finder page where users can select their departure and arrival stations to find the shortest route, and a page displaying the subway map in both Japanese and English. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No I do not plan to collaborate.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Should I actually deploy my Python Flask web application to a server or run it locally on my computer?
