# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I will build a web application aimed at providing users with an easy way to navigate Tokyo's complex subway system. It will consist of multiple pages, including a homepage with an overview of the subway system, a route finder page where users can select their departure and arrival stations to find the shortest route, and a page displaying the subway map in both Japanese and English. The backend of the application will be built using Python with the Flask framework, while the frontend will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Python will handle the logic for calculating routes between stations, while Flask will facilitate communication between the frontend and backend. HTML and CSS will be used for page structure and styling, while JavaScript will handle user interactions and dynamic content updates.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

By myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Should I actually deploy my Python Flask web application to a server or run it locally on my computer?
