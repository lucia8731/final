Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I've completed the initial development phase of the project, focusing on constructing the fundamental web pages using HTML and CSS, and I've integrated basic functionality with Flask. Specifically, I've created the landing page, the route finder page with the search form, and the train map page.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

 I've started implementing the backend logic for the route search feature, although it's still in progress. The backend logic includes handling user input from the form, but there's more work needed to fully implement the route search functionality.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
